  <h1>Step-by-Step Guide to Cooking Dinner</h1>
  <p>Sometimes you don't want to eat out. Sometimes the best food is the food you make at home. Here's a visual guide to how I make dinner on a weeknight.</p>

  <figure class="gallery-image">
    <img src="images/1.jpg" alt="Ingredients, plates, utensils, and seasonings on a countertop. There is a cutting board with a half-chopped onion on it. A plate has flour next to a plate of raw chicken.">
    <figcaption>
      First, I set out all my ingredients. I chop my onion. I chop my chicken and dredge it in flour. I smash some garlic cloves.

  <figure class="gallery-image">
    <img src="images/2.jpg" alt="Flour-coated chicken in a ceramic pan, surrounded by sizzling butter and whole garlic cloves.">
    <figcaption>
      Then, I heat my pan and melt butter in it. I put my chicken in and start cooking.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure class="gallery-image">
    <img src="images/3.jpg" alt="A spatula sits next to the pan of chicken. The chicken is now golden-brown. A pot of water sits on another burner, which is on.">
    <figcaption>
      I boil water on the stove in another pan for my pasta. I flip my chicken over once the bottom has gotten brown and crispy.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure class="gallery-image">
    <img src="images/4.jpg" alt="The chicken is out of the pan and on a paper towel in the background. Diced onions are in the pan now. The pot of pasta is off the burner and on the back of the stove.">
    <figcaption>
      I take my chicken out once it is crispy all over and toss my onions in with some oil. Once the pasta is boiled, I take my pasta off the heat. I cook my onions until they are fragrant.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure class="gallery-image">
    <img src="images/5.jpg" alt="The onions are now a different color because of the cooking process and the seasonings mixed in. The spatula rests against the edge of the pan, leaning on the stovetop.">
    <figcaption>
      Then, I season my onions and cook them until they are softer.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure class="gallery-image">
    <img src="images/6.jpg" alt="The pan now has red sauce, tomato paste, and cream in it, unmixed. The spatula sits off to the side. A bottle of lemon juice is nearby.">
    <figcaption>
      Next, I add my red sauce, tomato paste, cream, lemon juice, and other seasonings. I add some pasta water as well. This will all come together to make a creamy tomato pasta sauce.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure class="gallery-image">
    <img src="images/7.jpg" alt="The red sauce in the pan is mixed together. The elbow noodles have been mixed in as well.">
    <figcaption>
      Next, I add my pasta into the sauce to get them evenly coated. Now that the pasta part is done, Iâ€™m done cooking. I can eat.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure class="gallery-image">
    <img src="images/8.jpg" alt="The pasta and the noodles are now mixed together in a white bowl.">
    <figcaption>
      I put all my pasta and my crispy chicken in a bowl together. Time to eat.
